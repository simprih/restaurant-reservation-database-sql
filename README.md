-- Project name: Adria Bar Restaurant
--
-- The Adria Restaurant Database, Reservation Handling Part
--
-- This database describes a real waterfront restaurant located in Darling Harbour in Sydney.
-- It focuses on the reservation and private events handling work: taking booking requests, noting the customers' details,
-- when they plan to arrive and how many seats they need.
--
-- Some bookings are just a couple who want to be sure they have a table.
-- Others are private occasions such as birthdays or company functions. For these special reservations,
-- the system treats them as events. This way, it is possible to enter the event details and assign
-- specific team members to it, such as runners, waiters, and a manager if needed.
--
-- Tables can be available or occupied, and the team can quickly see upcoming bookings by time.
-- The goal is simple: keep track of guests and special occasions so that the restaurant can
-- prepare the right tables and staff at the right time.
